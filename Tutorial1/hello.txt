Hello everyone! I am Yihao Yang, a 4th year PhD candidate in Physics. 

Interested in computation driven approach to modelling neuronal networks, I am currently working on modelling acetylcholine dependent learning mechanism in human brain.

During this time, I began to enjoy hiking on weekends.

Excited to work with you all! Feel free to contact me at yihaoy@umich.edu.
